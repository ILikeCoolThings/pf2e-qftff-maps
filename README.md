# PF2e Quest for the Frozen Flame Map Remakes

This is a simple module that includes some scenes for book 2 of the PF2e AP Quest for the Frozen Flame. I found that the base maps weren't up to the quality I wanted, and also an excuse to learn to make maps. The level of detail is all over the place... but I think they are better than the pixelated maps from the AP. Calamtiy Caves is only upscaled as I started mapping after that point in my campaign.

The module does not contain any of the material or content from the book outside of the map remakes. 

Will be adding more as my group progresses through.
