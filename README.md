# PF2e QftFF Maps

This is a simple module that includes some scenes for book 2 of the PF2e AP Quest for the Frozen Flame. I found that the base maps weren't up to the quality I wanted, and also an excuse to learn to make maps. The quality is all over the place... but probably better than the pixelated maps from the AP. Some maps from earlier on may not exist as I was already past that point in my campaign.

Will be adding more as my group progresses through.
