# PF2e QftFF Maps

This is a simple module that includes some scenes for book 2 of the PF2e AP Quest for the Frozen Flame. Found that the base maps weren't up to the quality I wanted, and also an excuse to learn to map. The quality is all over the place... but probably better than the pixelated maps from the AP.

Will be adding more as my group progresses through the campaign.
